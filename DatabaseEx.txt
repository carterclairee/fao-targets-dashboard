* Question number 1 - URL names *

Option 1 : reusing the numbers 

/Focus-objective1/KeyArea1/expected-result1/a

Option 2 : Semantinc Url for imporved accesibility 

/homepage/         /Focus Objective Name /Key Area ID name/Expected Result title / 

/target-dashboard/protection-of-livestock/risk-monitoring/fast-global-surveillance

Database needs: 

Change table names for columns : 

* focus_objective table *

divide focus_objective_name into 2 

focus_objective_name
and 
focus_objective_subtitle that we will use to show the full text 

ex see the PERFECT OBJECT bellow 

* targets table *
 rename to = target
so that we can grab target.id 

indicator would a letter 

target_description can be just description and remove the "i)"

* Restructuring the Json elements *

We need to destructure : expected_result and indicator so that they are numeric rather than string/text

This is our current call and our current Object we receive from the DB 

SELECT * FROM targets WHERE key_area_id = 1 AND expected_result LIKE '1.1%'

 {
        "id": 1,
        "key_area_id": 1,
        "expected_result_number": "1.1.FAST global surveillance sustained and viral intelligence up-scaled ",
        "indicator": "1.1.1aNumber of reports on global FMD surveillance produced\n\n                   ",
        "target_description": "i) 16 quarterly reports and 4 annual reports",
        "Q4/2023": null,

        "Q4/2024": null,
        "annual_target": 16,
        "program_target": null
    },


This is our current call for the ideal Object 


SELECT
  fo.id AS focus_objective_id,
  fo.name AS focus_objective_name,
  ka.id AS key_area_id,
  ka.name AS key_area_name,
  t.id AS target_id,
  t.indicator,
  t.target_description,
  t.expected_result,
  t.annual_target,
  t.program_target,
  t.\`Q1/2024\`,
  t.\`Q2/2024\`,
  t.\`Q3/2024\`,
  t.\`Q4/2023\`,
  t.\`Q4/2024\`
FROM
  focus_objectives fo
INNER JOIN key_areas ka ON fo.id = ka.\`focus_objectives_id\`
INNER JOIN targets t ON ka.id = t.key_area_id
WHERE
  fo.id = 1 // 
ORDER BY
  ka.name ASC, t.id ASC;
`;

This is the object we receive

    },

We need to divide the expected_result in 2 to include expected_result_number
and if we have targets renamed as target 
    The IDEAL Object would be or rename the table targets to target
